## Problem Statement

The world is moving towards electric vehicles as a means to meet the increasing demand for clean energy and reduce emissions. To achieve this, the **Indian government has set a target of having 30% of all vehicles be electric by 2030**. This goal requires significant investment in the development of electric vehicle infrastructure and incentives to encourage the adoption of these vehicles.

Battery technology is advancing rapidly, with two main options for powering electric vehicles: battery charging and battery swapping. While charging stations have received widespread support, the implementation of battery swapping stations has been limited. Battery swapping is faster, more convenient, and more efficient than charging, making it an attractive alternative.

To support the growth of battery swapping, a robust software and hardware infrastructure is required. Blockchain technology can be used to support the software infrastructure by providing secure and efficient tracking of battery usage and exchange. The Internet of Things (IoT) can be utilized for the hardware infrastructure, enabling real-time monitoring and control of the battery swapping process.

By incorporating these technologies, the implementation of battery swapping stations can be streamlined, making it a more attractive option for consumers and leading to a more widespread adoption of electric vehicles.

- **Blockchain** can help with the **software** infrastructure while **IoT** can handle the **hardware** infrastructure.

## Solution

There is a need for a safe, secure, public and fast battery swapping system.

To address the need for a safe, secure, and efficient battery swapping system, we propose the development of ChargeSwap. ChargeSwap leverages the benefits of blockchain technology and IoT to create a secure, transparent, and efficient system for swapping batteries.

Blockchain technology provides secure and immutable transactions, while IoT enables the tracking of battery location and usage. This allows users to quickly and easily swap their depleted batteries for fully charged ones at the lowest cost possible.

To ensure that the energy used by ChargeSwap is environmentally friendly, we will only implement the system using renewable energy sources. By using renewable energy, we ensure that the user does not have to pay more for energy and reduce the carbon footprint of the battery swapping process. IoT will be used to track and manage battery information, providing real-time data on the battery's status and usage.

By combining the benefits of blockchain technology and IoT, ChargeSwap provides a cost-effective and environmentally responsible solution for battery swapping.

## Target Market

Our primary target is electric vehicle owners and drivers who have vehicles with swappable batteries.The market for this technology is expected to grow in the next 10 years as the world shifts towards electric vehicles.In India alone, the government predicts that 30% of vehicles will be electric by 2030.The service does not require the user to have a web3 wallet, as payments can be made through web2 services as well. Our target market is individuals who are looking for a convenient and efficient way to swap their vehicle's batteries.

## Objective/Goal

The objective is to be a leader in the cutting-edge and growing field of electric vehicles and battery swapping. We aim to revolutionize the experience for all electric vehicle users, particularly those who utilize swappable batteries. Our goal is to create a seamless and impactful solution that enhances the lives of those who choose to drive electric. Help me on the mission to shape the future of clean transportation.

## Why use blockchain?

Maximize your Electric Vehicle's potential with the innovative integration of Internet of Things (IOT) and Blockchain technology. The combination ensures secure and permanent ledger storage of all your battery's vital information like age, usage, charging history and more. Say goodbye to manual tracking, as IOT seamlessly updates this information in real-time. Embrace a hassle-free swapping experience, as smart contracts on the blockchain streamline the entire process. Upgrade your charging experience with the power of IOT & Blockchain!

This integration provides a comprehensive solution that ensures a high level of transparency, accountability, and efficiency, making the system more reliable and secure.This data is accessible to authorized entities, ensuring that all transactions are transparent and auditable. Additionally, smart contracts on the blockchain can be used to automate the battery swapping process, reducing the risk of fraud and errors.

## Technologies Used:

- Polygon: for scalability, lower transaction fees, and faster speeds
- Push Protocol: for communications, notifications
- IPFS: to store the metadata for the batteries used
- Biconomy: used for social login and reducing the steps taken in UX
